// In a modern e-commerce platform, you are tasked with developing a feature that allows users to apply discounts based on promotional codes.

// Each discount has specific criteria—for instance, some discounts can only apply if the total amount exceeds a certain value.
//  Additionally, these discounts may have expiration dates.

//   You'll need to create a JavaScript function that takes an array of promotional codes and an order total as input.

//    Each code is represented by an object containing properties such as code, discountPercentage, minTotalRequired, and expirationDate. 

//   Your function should determine which applicable discount provides the maximum savings for the user and return both the applicable code and
//  its corresponding savings amount. 

//   It’s essential that your implementation ensures closure properties are utilized correctly when handling potential edge cases like
//  multiple applicable codes or invalid codes (e.g., expired ones). 

//   Please write your JavaScript function below:

function getDiscount(promoCodes, orderTotal) {
    
}
